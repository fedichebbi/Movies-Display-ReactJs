## Coding

In this project , I have used : 
### Directory Architecture : 
JavaScript and CSS files that belongs to a component are located in a single folder.
### React router dom :
A library that allows the app navigation
### Material UI : 
A library that provides UI components

## Design:
### All app :
The application contains 3 sections :
- Common Header
- Body Container where the app navigation happens
- Common Footer
### First Page :
The first screen contains : 
- TextField (Material UI component) that allow user to make his movie's filtering by entering the name .
- GridList (Material UI component) that displays movies into 3 Grids per line
- Text : display movie's name
- Select / MenuItem (Material UI components) that displays languages and filter movies according to the selection
### Second Page :
The second page displays the movie's image and some details
### 404 not found Page :
Displays an error message whenever you enter a wrong url
## Remark:
### Displaying "not found image" is due to data missing from the API
